    <h1>Hello! Welcome to Dylan Cochran's Assignment 4, what used to be Assignment 2!</h1>
    <p>Something I find interesting is <strong>Fantasy Football.</strong> It has gotten more popular and traction over the years, as gambling has gotten more popular, but I must stress that gambling is <strong>NOT</strong> required to play the game! In fact, I have personally <strong>NEVER</strong> played in a league for money. Fantasy football can be played on many platforms, such as <a href="https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/" title="ESPN Fantasy Football link">ESPN's Fantasy Football platform.</a> The fundamental concept of the game is quite simple! Each week in the NFL, with the exception of a bye, each team will play 1 game. Therefore, you too will play 1 game. Through this, you can pick a team at the beginning of the season, and each week your players will play 1 game and score points for you based on their real life performance! At the end of the season, a playoffs are played and a winner is crowned, <strong> the glory of the championship is why we play! </strong></p>
